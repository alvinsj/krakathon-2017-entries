Create a power 4 game in COBOL.

The goal of the game is to align a series of 4 counters of the same color on a grid with 6 rows and 7 columns.
In turn the two players place a pawn in the column of their choice, the pawn then slides to the lowest possible position in the said column after which it is the opponent to play. The winner is the player who makes the first alignment (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) consecutive of at least four pawns of his color. If, while all the squares of the game grid are filled, neither of the two players has achieved such an alignment, the game is declared void.
